# Enrichment Map Example 

## Introduction 
This repository has scripts to use Pathway Commons to generate [EnrichmentMaps](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21085593) using the [clusterProfiler](https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/clusterProfiler.html) with some modification. 

## Data 
Uses gene lists from the paper [Jordan NV et al., HER2 expression identifies dynamic functional states within circulating breast cancer cells, Nature, 2016](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27556950) developed on a single-cell dataset derived from circulating tumour cells from 19 women with ER+/HER2- primary tumours.
